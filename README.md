# Smart Bracelet with ESP32 for Health Monitoring

## Overview
This project is a smart bracelet that monitors heart rate, oxygen saturation, temperature, and sends this data via SMS to caregivers using an ESP32 microcontroller, MAX30102 sensor, DS18B20 temperature sensor, and an OLED display. When caregivers respond via SMS, the data is displayed on the OLED screen.

## Setting Up ESP32 in Arduino IDE

To use the ESP32 in Arduino IDE, follow these steps:

1. **Install the ESP32 Board Manager URL:**
   - Open Arduino IDE.
   - Go to `File > Preferences`.
   - In the "Additional Boards Manager URLs" field, add the following URL:
     ```
     https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
     ```
   
2. **Install ESP32 Board:**
   - Go to `Tools > Board > Boards Manager`.
   - Search for `esp32` and click "Install" to add the ESP32 boards to your IDE.

3. **Select the Correct Board and Port:**
   - Go to `Tools > Board` and select `ESP32 Dev Module` (or your specific ESP32 model).
   - Go to `Tools > Port` and select the appropriate COM port for your ESP32.

## Power Management

1. **Battery Considerations:**
   - The **26650 Li-Ion** battery with a **BMS** is responsible for powering the ESP32 and sensors.
   - Ensure the **BMS** is properly managing the charging and discharging of the battery to prevent damage.
   - Consider adding a low battery detection system to avoid power loss.
